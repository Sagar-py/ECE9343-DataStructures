Additionally, the total number of elements of all arrays is $kn$. (Notice that the number of elements of each array is not necessary the same). One of your algorithms should run in $O(kn.logn)$ time. Please give the procedure of your algorithm and analyze the running time. (Description is enough, you do not need to provide any pseudocode)\n",
