    "What is the running time of DFS if the graph is given as an adjacency list and adjacency matrix? Justify your running time.\n",

    "### Solution\n",
    "If the number of the nodes in graph is $V$ and the number of edges in the graph are $E$, then the running time would be $-$\n",
    "<br>Adjacency list: $O(V+E)$</br>\n",
    "<br>Adjacency matrix: $O(V^2)$ </br>\n",

    "In DFS, we will visit every node once and visit those nodes that are adjacent to them. In both the cases, we first need $O(V)$ time to visit all nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use adjacency list, we only need to visit every edge in each list which is $O(E)$. So, the total running time will $O(V)+O(E)=O(V+E)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use the adjacency matrix, although there are only $E$ edges, once we visit a node (i.e., the $i^{th}$ node), we will visit the element in the $i^{th}$ row of the adjacency matrix. In total, we will visit every element in the adjacency matrix, which is $V^2$. So, the total running time will be $O(V^2)+O(V)=O(V^2)$."

    "Write a method that takes any two nodes $u$ and $v$ in a tree $T$, and quickly determines if the node $u$ in the tree is a *descendant* or *ancestor* of node $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "We could run DFS on a tree $T$ and set the start node as the root and record the discover time and finish time over node. Because $T$ is a tree, the number of edges will be $n-1$. So, the total running time is $O(V+E)=O(n+n-1)=O(n)$. As we have proved in the textbook, given any 2 nodes $u$, $v$ in the DFS tree, if $u.d < v.d < v.f < u.f$, $u$ is the ancestor of $v$. Else if $v.d < u.d < u.f < v.f$, $u$ is the descendant of $v$. Because we only need $O(n)$ time to complete DFS and store the discover time and finish time. Other operations are in constant time $O(1)$, so the total running time is $O(n)$. More specifically, we need $O(n)$ time to initialize and $O(1)$ time to determine the relationship between two nodes."
