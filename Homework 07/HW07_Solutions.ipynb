    "## Question 01\n",
    "Suppose that we wish to implement a dynamic, open-address hash table. Why might we consider the table to be full when its load factor reaches some value $\\alpha$ that is strictly less than $1$? Describe briefly how to make insertion into a dynamic, open-address hash table run in such a way that the expected value of the amortized cost per insertion is $O(1)$. Why is the expected value of the actual cost per insertion not necessarily $O(1)$ for all insertions? (Exercise 17.4-1 in CLRS Textbook, page 471)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "**A.** For a static open-address hash table, we need to note that by Theorem 11.6, if the load factor $\\alpha$ is euqal to 1, the number of probes in an unsuccessful search may reach infinity. Therefore, we must assure that $\\alpha$ is strictly less than 1.\n",
    "<br>Theorem 11.6 states that $-$ \"Given an open-address hash table with a load factor $\\alpha = \\frac{n}{m} < 1$, the expected number of probes in an unsuccessful search is at most $\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}$, assuming uniform hashing\" </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**B.** For a static open-address hash table, by Theorem 11.7, as long as we can ensure that table expansion does not change the amortized worst case behavior of insertion, we are guaranteed $O(1)$ insertion.\n",
    "<br>Theorem 11.7 states that $-$ \"Inserting an element into an open-address hash table with a load factor $\\alpha$ requires at most $\\frac{1}{1- \\alpha}$ probes on average, assuming uniform hashing\" </br>\n",
    "<br>To keep insertion time reasonable, insertion into a dynamic open-address hash table can be made to run in $O(1)$ time by expanding when $\\alpha \\ge 0.75$ and contracting when $\\alpha \\le 0.25$ </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>If the table is at least half full $-$ $\\phi_i = \\frac{8}{3}num_i - size_i$ </br>\n",
    "<br>If the table is less than half full $-$ $\\phi_i = \\frac{1}{2}size_i - num_i$ </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>The expansion factor and contraction factor of table size is $2$ and $\\frac{1}{2}$ respectively. When the load factor is less than $\\frac{1}{4}$, the proof of deletion operation is the same. Our objective is to prove that the amortized cost when we expand the hash table is still $O(1)$. </br>\n",
    "<br>$num_i = num_{i-1} + 1$ </br>\n",
    "<br>$size_i = 2.size_{i-1}$ </br>\n",
    "<br>$num_{i-1} = \\frac{3}{4}size_{i-1}$ </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, $\\alpha_i = c_i + \\phi_i - \\phi_{i-1}$\n",
    "<br>$\\Rightarrow \\alpha_i = (num_{i-1}+1)+(\\frac{1}{2}size_i - num_i)-(\\frac{8}{3}num_{i-1}-size_{i-1})$ </br>\n",
    "<br>$\\Rightarrow \\alpha_i = (num_{i-1}+1)+2.size_{i-1}-\\frac{11}{3}num_{i-1}-1$ </br>\n",
    "<br>$\\Rightarrow \\alpha_i =(num_{i-1}+1)+\\frac{8}{3}num_{i-1}-\\frac{11}{3}num_{i-1}-1$ </br>\n",
    "<br>$\\Rightarrow \\alpha_i = 0$ </br>\n",
    "<br>$\\Rightarrow \\alpha_i = O(1)$ </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**C.** The expected value of the actual cost per insertion is not necessarily $O(1)$ for all insertions because the cost of inserting the $m$-th element into a \"full\" table costs $O(m)$, since all $m-1$ items must be copied into the new table before the new element can be inserted."
